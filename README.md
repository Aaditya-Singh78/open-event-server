# open-event-server
The Open Event Server enables organizers to manage events from concerts to conferences and meet-ups.

## Intro

This branch is a `v3` rewrite of the backend REST API and a work in progress. 
This new version of the API uses [Python]([https://www.python.org)](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html),
[Django 5](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/5.0/)
and the [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org).
Curently data is stored in sqlite althouhg this might change in the future.

If you want to collaborate feel free to have a look at our
[first issues](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aopen-for-all+label%3Av3+).

## Quickstart

We're going to install and configure the latest develop build of this API.

### Clone the project

First of all, you need to clone the project on your computer with :

```
git clone https://github.com/cecethea/open-event-server.git
```

You can now move in the newly created folder:

```
cd open_event_server
```

### Create a virtual environment

[Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) provides an isolated Python environment, which are more practical than installing packages system-wide. They also allow packages to be installed without administrator privileges.

1. Create a new virtual environment
```
virtualenv env
```

2. Activate the virtual environment
```
. env/bin/activate
```

You need to ensure the virtual environment is active each time you want to launch the project.

### Install all requirements

Requirements of the project are stored in the `requirements.txt` file.
You can install them with:

**WARNING** : Make sure your virtual environment is active or you will install the packages system-wide.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Configure the database

Django has a versioning system to genreate the database called
[migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/migrations/).
You first need to apply all existing "migrations" to update your local database.

```
python manage.py migrate
```

**Note:** The project uses a squlite3 file as database to simplify developement.
Once in production, feel free to switch to whatever suits you.

### Launch the API

You can now launch an instance of the API and visit the built-in admin website.

To login into the admin page, you'll need to create a superuser first:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Launch a local API instance with:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now visit these links to validate the installation:

- The root of the API: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/),
- The admin site: [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin),
- The autogenerated documentation: [http://localhost:8000/docs/](http://localhost:8000/docs)
